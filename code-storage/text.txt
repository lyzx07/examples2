Before starting a website development job for a client, you should go over the following things:

Purpose and Scope: 
Understand the purpose and scope of the website. Ask the client about their business objectives, 
target audience, and any specific requirements they may have.

Content: 
Ask the client to provide you with content such as text, images, videos, and other media. If necessary, 
provide suggestions on improving their content.

Design: 
Discuss the design or layout of the website with the client. It's important to have a clear understanding 
of the client's expectations and preferences.

Branding: 
Understand the clientâ€™s branding, style guide, and any existing marketing communications efforts.

Budget and Timeline: 
Determine the budget and the expected timeline of the project. Discuss any additional expenses that might 
arise during development such as hosting, domain name, and third-party integrations.

Maintenance and Support: 
Discuss maintenance and support requirements. Some clients require regular maintenance, feature updates, 
and support for their website.


As the developer, you can either sign up for the hosting account on behalf of the client or guide the 
client through the sign-up process. If you sign up on behalf of the client, you will typically be asked 
to provide the client's personal and billing information. However, if the client prefers to have ownership 
and control of the hosting account, they can sign up directly and provide you with the necessary credentials 
to access the account. The specific approach will depend on the arrangement and agreement between you and 
the client.

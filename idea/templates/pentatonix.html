        <p>
          <b>Scott Hoying:</b><br />
          tall blond guy, natural baritone but has an impressive five-to-six
          octave range, can go all the way up to high tenor and down to bass,
          sings the bass lines when the usual bass singer takes the lead
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Kirstin "Kirstie"Maldonado:</b><br />

          are off the scale. For a time in 2018 between the group's tours, had
          the female lead on Broadway in the production of “Kinky Boots”.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Mitch Grassi:</b><br />
          a true contra-tenor, can hit high notes in his chest voice with ease
          and go WAY higher in his falsetto, also with ease
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Avriel "Avi" Kaplan:</b><br />
          dark beard and long hair, true basso profundo, trained as an opera
          singer, also can go up into the tenor range
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Kevin "KO" Olusola:</b><br />
          beatboxer extraordinaire, also is a world-class cellist who plays
          cello on some of their songs, has a beautiful high tenor voice and
          gets occasional lead vocal solos as well, graduated pre-med from Yale
          and speaks several languages including Mandarin Chinese.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Matt Salee:</b><br />
          Newest member. Replaced Avi in 2017. Brings great energy to the group
          and has a voice like butter.
        </p>
        <p>
          They won The Sing Off in 2011. They made a guest starring appearance
          on America's Got Talent as non-competitors a couple of years after
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kirstie, Scott & Mitch grew up together in Arlington, Texas, and began
          performing together as children in local youth musical theater. They
          ended up in high school together and performed in the choir. While
          there, they formed an a cappella group called The Trio which had
          several performance videos go viral on YouTube, most notably a cover
          of Lady Gaga's "Telephone".
        </p>
        <p>
          The three of them are best friends and consider themselves to be
          almost siblings. Scott & Kirstie (who were a class year ahead of
          Mitch) both graduated high school in 2010 and went their separate ways
          to different colleges, Scott at USC and Kirstie at Oklahoma.
        </p>
        <p>
          While at USC, Scott joined a USC-based a cappella group called the
          SoCal VoCals, where he met alumnus Ben Bram, who was now an arranger
          and vocal coach for the NBC TV show The Sing Off, an a cappella
          competition show. Ben convinced Scott to get The Trio to audition for
          the show. The three reunited (Mitch had to skip high school graduation
          ceremonies to go) in Los Angeles for the audition.
        </p>
        <p>
          They found out that the rules had changed, so they needed at least
          five members to audition. Ben put them together with Avi (a native of
          Visalia, California), who he knew from Avi's performing days at Mount
          San Antonio College in California. They found Kevin (from Kentucky)
          through one of his YouTube videos that had gone viral featuring him
          playing the cello and beatboxing at the same time, a talent that Kevin
          coined as "Cello-Boxing". Kevin arrived in Los Angeles literally the
          day before the audition!
        </p>
        <p>
          Scott came up with the name "Pentatonix" after the pentatonic scale.
          They performed a re-arrangement of "The Telephone" for the audition
          and passed, despite having been together as a five-piece group for
          less that 24 hours! They won The Sing Off that season in which they
          received a substantial cash prize AND a record contract with Epic
          Records.
        </p>
        <p>
          They pooled their prize winnings together and all moved to Los
          Angeles, and all got apartments right next door to each other in the
          same building. But just a week later, Epic dropped them because the
          marketing people didn't think an a cappella group could sell records.
          Instead of giving up, they were determined and began recording their
          own songs on YouTube, hiring Ben Bram as their producer and arranger.
          These usually consisted of the five of them sitting on a couch and
          performing cover songs live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several of the videos went viral, and Sony (the parent company of
          Epic) decided to give them another chance by placing them on one of
          their smaller labels, Madison Gate. They released two secular EPs and
          one Christmas EP on Madison Gate, all of which were strong sellers.
          But when their cover of a medley of songs by Daft Punk not only went
          super-viral, but also won them their first Grammy, they were promoted
          all the way up to RCA Records, Sony's top label.
        </p>
        <p>
          They began writing and producing their own songs in addition to their
          covers, began putting out a Christmas album just about annually (which
          has become their best-selling genre), and have had multi-platinum
          album sales, sold-out world tours, and have won two additional
          Grammys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Avi began getting burned out with all of the touring and heavy
          recording schedule, was suffering from anxiety and personal problems,
          and learned that his mother had been diagnosed with cancer in 2017. He
          announced he was departing from the group and taking some time away
          from the music industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt Sallee (from Baltimore) joined them in September 2017. He did
          only become official when they renewed their RCA contract in February
          2018, but he recorded with them in September as a featured artist and
          went on their Christmas tour as a featured artist, as well. When he
          attended the audition for the group, he had already mastered the Bass
          part for most if not all their past catalogue. He was successful and
          has proved that he fits in well with the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ben Bram has been in charge of their production, including arranging
          and directing from the beginning. He is often referred to as the sixth
          member. Scott and Kevin are major players in the arrangements, but
          every member contributes. A good watch is "The Recording of Evergreen"
          where a camera was invited into the studio for the second week of
          recording.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, all members are songwriters for both Pentatonix and their own
          solo work. Ed Boyer who mixes everything of theirs (even the HWB
          Livestream) is the one who pulled Ben Bram into the sing off in the
          first place. They were nominated for a 4th Grammy for their album
          Evergreen, but didn't win.
        </p>
        <p>
          They have a star on the Hollywood walk of fame installed in February
          2023. They are the only a capella group with a star! They came 3rd in
          the 2023 Masked Singer performing as "California Rolls" being unmasked
          on May 23, 2023.

        <dd>
          The pentatonic scale is a musical scale that consists of five notes
          per octave. It is widely used in various styles of music, including
          folk, blues, rock, and jazz. The name "pentatonic" derives from the
          Greek words pente (meaning "five") and tonos (meaning "tone").

    <div class="phrases text-center">
      <dl>
        <dt>Does Kevin(the beatboxer) sing?</dt>
        <dd>
          He does indeed sing. He has a beautiful counter tenor voice....more
          stuff
        </dd>
        <dt>How many member changes have there been?</dt>
        <dd>
          Only one member has changed. Avi left the group amicably in 2017 and
          Matt replaced him.
        </dd>
        <dt>Is that the same guy/girl?</dt>
        <dd>
          Yes it is. Kirsty and Mitch change their looks A LOT, but it is always
          them.
        </dd>
        <dt>Are there any instruments?</dt>
        <dd>
          Short answer, no there are not any instruments used unless you see
          one. The sounds all come from their own voices and bodies. They do
          have the occassional track that does have some kind of unorganic
          sound, but those songs are rare.
        </dd>
        <dt>Do they sound the same live?</dt>
        <dd>
          Absolutely! Sometimes they sound better than their recorded versions.
          They dont produce songs that can't be performed live.
        </dd>
        <dt>Is Scott the lead singer?</dt>
        <dd>
          No. Pentatonix doesn't have a lead singer. They take turns depending
          on what is best for the song. That being said he is considered the
          motivater and when performing on the Sing-off they did require the
          group to have a lead of sorts, which was Scott.
        </dd>
        <dt>Where is Kevin!!!</dt>
        <dd>
          In the very popular performance of Aha in Singapore Kevin is not seen
          on screen in the begining of the video because he is putting his cello
          away after doing some cello boxing. He returns later, but is never
          seen do to the person recording focusing on Mitch.
        </dd>
        <dt>How do I pronounce Kirsten's name</dt>
        <dd>
          Like Thirsty but dont take my word for it.<br />
